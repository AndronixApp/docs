# 4. Andronix-maintainers

## Utilities

* `./build-all.sh`:

Build all packages in the correct order \(using `./scripts/buildorder.py`\).

* `./clean.sh`:

Cleaning build environment.

* `./scripts/check-built-packages.py`:

Compare local \(git\) and remote \(apt\) package versions.

* `./scripts/check-pie.sh`:

Verify that all binaries are using PIE, which is required for Android 5+.

* `./scripts/check-versions.sh`:

Check for package updates.

* `./scripts/ldd`:

Print list of required shared libraries for given binary.

* `./scripts/lint-packages.sh`:

Do basic checks for problems in `build.sh` scripts.

* `./scripts/list-packages.sh`:

List all packages with a one-line summary.

* `./scripts/package_uploader.sh`:

Upload packages to Bintray.

## Uploading packages \(Bintray\)

Upload is done by executing script `./scripts/package_uploader.sh` with package

name as argument. Note that \*.deb files must have name in format `{name}_{full-version}_{arch}.deb`.

It is expected that \*.deb files are located in `./debs`, but can be changed by

passing argument `-p /path/to/deb_dir`.

Example:

```text
./scripts/package_uploader.sh -p ./my_built_packages bash
```

Authentication credentials are supplied through environment variables:

`BINTRAY_USERNAME` - User name on [Bintray](https://bintray.com).

`BINTRAY_API_KEY` - Personal API key on [Bintray](https://bintray.com).

`BINTRAY_GPG_PASSPHRASE` - A passphrase for your GPG key stored on [Bintray](https://bintray.com).

Any operations \(except download\) on APT repository can be done only by

maintainers who have _write_ access.

### Deleting packages

To delete package from APT repository, use pass argument `-d` with list of

package names to `package_uploader.sh`:

```text
./scripts/package_uploader.sh -d {package names}
```

**Warning:** never delete packages when upload is not finished. This may result

in metadata inconsistency.

### Deleting old versions

\*We keep old versions only for technical reasons - to prevent 404 errors when

users download packages.\*

Pass argument `-c` with list of packages which should be cleaned. Example:

```text
./scripts/package_uploader.sh -c bash busybox coreutils libllvm
```

**Warning:** never clean versions when \*.deb files for specific architectures

were not updated. This will made package unavailable for some devices.

### Regenerating metadata

In certain cases you may need to force-regenerate metadata. This can be done in

following way:

```text
./scripts/package_uploader.sh -r
```

## Generating bootstrap archives

Bootstrap archives is a zip archives of `$TERMUX_PREFIX` with basic packages

preinstalled and used to create a minimal working environment on first start

of Termux application.

Utilities to generate bootstrap archives available in [https://github.com/andronixapp/packaging](https://github.com/andronixapp/packaging)

repository. Highly recommended to use script located in [scripts/generate-bootstraps.sh](https://github.com/andronixapp/packaging/blob/master/scripts/generate-bootstraps.sh).

Termux bootstraps \(that used for `https://dl.bintray.com/andronixapp/termux-packages-24`\)

are generated with the following command:

```text
./generate-bootstraps.sh
```

Default script configuration is

```text
Architectures: aarch64 arm i686 x86_64

Repository URL: https://dl.bintray.com/termux/termux-packages-24

Prefix: /data/data/com.termux/files/usr
```

so if you want to generate bootstraps for custom repository, consider using

following command line options:

* `--architectures` - Comma separated list of architectures for which bootstraps

should be generated.

* `--prefix` - `$TERMUX_PREFIX` against which your packages are built.
* `--repository` - URL of your APT repository. Offline bootstrap generation is not

supported.
