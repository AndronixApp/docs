{% page-ref page="intellij-idea.md" %}

Just follow the same procedure and **rename the tar.gz and folder** to the IDE that you're downloading. Just start the IDE with navigating to the **bin** folder of the extracted tar and finding a shell file with the name of the IDE. Execute it with - 

```text
./<IDE-name>.sh
```
